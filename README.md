# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project
Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. (3 pt)
### Purpose of Project
In this project, I demonstrated my proficiency with various features in excel including: conditional formatting, debugging errors, VLOOKUPs, and creating interactive charts and graphs with pivot charts. To accomplish these goals, I was given a fictional situation and data set of several thousand crowdfunding projects. 
### Background of Project
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present your results. You will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)

## Results 
Results:
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)

Based on the line graph above, I had the following takeways about theather campaigns:
* May, June, and July respectively had the highest number of successful campaigns. 
* October and May respectively had the highest number of failed campaigns.
* December had about as many successful campaigns as failed ones.
* In every month there were more successful than failed campagins. Generally, the successful and failed trend lines create the same shape and are similar to each other with the exception of May, October, and December. In May, the larger than average gap between successful and failed campaigns suggests a better chance for success. In October, the smaller than average gap between successful and failed campaigns suggests a better chance for failure.
