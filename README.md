# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose of Project
In this project, I demonstrated my proficiency with various features in Pandas, Jupytier Notebook, and Matplotlib including: inspecting data, creating data series and data frames, merging data sets, performing calculations, and producing publication-quality figures to tell a visual story from the data. 

### Background of Project
Pyber, a ride-sharing app company, is tyring to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. To provide recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types, a line graph was created to showcase the relationship between the type of city, number of riders and drivers, as well as the percentage of total fares. First, I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type using Python and Pandas. Then, I created a multiple-line chart that shows the total weekly fares for each city type using Pandas and Matplotlib. Finally, I summarized how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results 
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)

Based on the line graph above, I had the following takeways about theather campaigns:
* May, June, and July respectively had the highest number of successful campaigns. 
* October and May respectively had the highest number of failed campaigns.
* December had about as many successful campaigns as failed ones.
* In every month there were more successful than failed campagins. Generally, the successful and failed trend lines create the same shape and are similar to each other with the exception of May, October, and December. In May, the larger than average gap between successful and failed campaigns suggests a better chance for success. In October, the smaller than average gap between successful and failed campaigns suggests a better chance for failure.
